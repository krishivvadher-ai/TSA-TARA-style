# TSA Critical Thinking and Problem Solving sets

Every TSA Oxford Section 1 paper from 2008 to 2023 (16 years) split into a
**Critical Thinking** set and a **Problem Solving** set, each with its own
time limit and mark scheme.

## Folders

| Folder | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `TSA_Papers/` | `TSA_<year>_Critical_Thinking.pdf` and `TSA_<year>_Problem_Solving.pdf` |
| `TSA_Answers/` | `TSA_<year>_Critical_Thinking_Mark_Scheme.pdf` and `TSA_<year>_Problem_Solving_Mark_Scheme.pdf` |

Each year therefore has four documents: two papers and their two mark schemes.

## The papers

- The cover page gives the title (for example *TSA 2015 Critical Thinking*),
  the number of questions, the total marks and the time limit.
- Questions are renumbered 1, 2, 3 … within each set. The original question
  number from the TSA paper follows in brackets, e.g. **1 (Q3)**.
- Each question is reproduced exactly as printed in the original paper,
  including all diagrams, tables and graphs.

Every set has 25 questions, so each paper is worth **25 marks** (one mark per
question, with no penalty for incorrect answers).

## Time limits

The time limits are based on the TARA (Test of Academic Reasoning for
Admissions) modules: Critical Thinking is 22 questions in 40 minutes, and
Problem Solving is 22 questions in 40 minutes. Each limit is scaled to the
number of questions in the set and rounded to the nearest minute:

| Set | Questions | Calculation | Time limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Critical Thinking | 25 | 25 × 40 ÷ 22 = 45.45 | **45 minutes** |
| Problem Solving | 25 | 25 × 40 ÷ 22 = 45.45 | **45 minutes** |

## Mark schemes

Each mark scheme lists the set's question numbers (1–25, matching the
renumbered paper) and the correct option. Original TSA question numbers are
deliberately left out. Answers come from the official Section 1 answer keys.

## How questions were classified

TSA Section 1 always contains 25 Critical Thinking and 25 Problem Solving
questions, placed in fixed positions:

| Years | Critical Thinking (original question numbers) | Problem Solving |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2008–2019 | 1, 3–5, 9–11, 15–17, 21–23, 27–29, 33–35, 39–41, 45–47 | all others |
| 2020–2023 | 1, 3–5, 9–11, 15–17, 21–23, 27–29, 33–35, 39–41, 45, 47, 49 | all others |

Every question was also checked individually by its question type. Critical
Thinking questions ask about arguments: main conclusions, assumptions, flaws,
strengthening or weakening, principles and parallel reasoning. Problem Solving
questions are numerical, spatial and data questions. The full list is in
`tools/classification.json`.

## Rebuilding

`tools/build_tsa_sets.py` regenerates everything from the original question
papers and answer keys:

```
pip install pymupdf reportlab
python tools/build_tsa_sets.py --papers <folder of question papers> --answers <folder of answer keys>
```

To change the timing basis, edit the `TARA` settings at the top of the script.
